- [x] Determine authentication requirements (none required for public data)
- [x] Document API usage, rate limits, and license requirements
- [x] Create comprehensive notes in `data-search/ALA_API_NOTES.md`
- [x] Document species identification method

### 14. Develop ALA media search script ✅
- [x] Create `data-search/search_ala_photos.py`
- [x] Use ALA API to search for bird photos by scientific name
- [x] Filter for appropriate licenses (CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC0)
- [x] Extract photo URL, source page, license, and attribution
- [x] Format output to match existing photo data structure
- [x] Add error handling and rate limiting (2s between requests)

### 15. Test ALA media search script ⏳
- [x] Create comprehensive testing guide (`data-search/ALA_TESTING_GUIDE.md`)
- [ ] Test script with a few bird species (requires human to run tests)
- [ ] Verify photo URLs are accessible and correctly formatted
- [ ] Verify attribution and license data is captured correctly
- [ ] Test with species that have no existing photos
- [ ] Test with species that already have photos
- [ ] Document any issues or limitations found
- [ ] Create a sample output file for review

**Note**: Testing requires running against live ALA API. A comprehensive testing guide has been created with 10 test cases. Human testing recommended before production use.

## PWA Conversion

### 16. Basic PWA setup (Phase 1) ✅
- [x] Create a `manifest.json` with app name, icons, theme color, display mode (standalone)
- [x] Generate PWA icons at required sizes (192x192, 512x512) from existing favicon
- [x] Register a service worker with offline caching strategy
- [x] Cache bird data (`act_birds.json`), app shell, and key assets for offline use
- [x] Add install prompt UI (e.g., subtle banner or menu option for "Add to Home Screen")
- [ ] Test installability on Android Chrome, iOS Safari, and desktop
- [ ] Verify the app works offline after first load

### 17. Push notification backend (Phase 2) ✅
- [x] Create a Cloudflare Worker to handle push subscription management
- [x] Set up KV namespace (or D1 database) to store Web Push subscriptions

- [x] Handle expired/invalid subscriptions gracefully (remove on 410 response)

### 18. Push notification frontend (Phase 3) ✅
- [x] Add notification permission request UI in the app (opt-in, not aggressive)
- [x] Implement service worker `push` event handler to display notifications
- [x] Implement `notificationclick` handler to open the app/daily challenge
- [x] Subscribe to push notifications and send subscription to backend
- [x] Add a setting to enable/disable notifications
- [x] Store notification preference in localStorage
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome, iOS Safari (home screen PWA), and desktop

## Tasks Requiring Human Input (Not for Autonomous Session)

The following items from feedback cannot be completed autonomously:

- **Hosting audio files**: Infrastructure decision needed from human
- **Rename the game**: Creative/branding decision
- **Design assets/favicon**: Requires graphic design work
- **Review links page**: Human verification of accuracy needed
- **Write complete about page**: Needs human contact information and messaging
- **Actually reviewing photos with the tool**: Human needs to use the photo review tool to flag inappropriate images
- **Integrating ALA photos into dataset**: Human needs to review and approve which ALA photos to add

## Notes

- Work through tasks in order where possible
- Commit changes frequently with clear messages
- Run `npm run dev` to test changes locally
- If a task is blocked or unclear, document the issue and move to the next task
